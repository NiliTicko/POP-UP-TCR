# POP-UP-TCR
The essential role of T cells in the adaptive immune response makes it highly desirable to elucidate their epitope specificity. We analyzed structurally characterized TCR-peptide complexes and, based on this analysis, trained a set of machine learning models, POP-UP TCR (Prediction of Previously Unseen Paired TCR-pMHC) that predict the binding of any peptide to any TCR. 

Your dataset file should have the following columns:
- A column of CDR3 beta sequences 
- A column of peptide sequences
- A column of TCR identification number
- A column of status, e.g., 'healthy/ sick'.
